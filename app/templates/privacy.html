            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><em>Last updated: December 2025</em></p>

            <p>Return... is designed with your privacy in mind. We believe your meditation practice is personal, and your data should stay that way.</p>

            <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
            <p>Return... does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. We have no analytics, no tracking, and no advertising.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No personal information</li>
                <li>No usage analytics</li>
                <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
                <li>No third-party SDKs that collect data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
            <p>Return... stores your preferences and settings locally on your device. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Timer duration preferences</li>
                <li>Selected theme (Water, Fire, Forest, Silence)</li>
                <li>Bell sound and repeat settings</li>
                <li>HealthKit logging preference</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data never leaves your device except through iCloud sync (described below).</p>

            <h2>Apple Health Integration</h2>
            <p>If you enable HealthKit integration, Return... can log your meditation sessions as "Mindful Minutes" to Apple Health. This data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is stored in Apple Health on your device</li>
                <li>Is managed by Apple's Health app</li>
                <li>Is not accessible to us or any third party</li>
                <li>Can be deleted at any time through Apple Health</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can disable HealthKit integration at any time in the app's settings.</p>

            <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
            <p>Return... uses iCloud Key-Value Store to sync your settings and session history across your Apple devices. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your data is encrypted and stored in your personal iCloud account</li>
                <li>Only you have access to this data</li>
                <li>We have no access to your iCloud data</li>
                <li>You can manage or delete this data through your iCloud settings</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Return... is a standalone app with no external dependencies for data processing. We use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No analytics services (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)</li>
                <li>No crash reporting services</li>
                <li>No advertising networks</li>
                <li>No social media integrations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Return... does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app does not require any personal information to function.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
