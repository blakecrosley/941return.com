            <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

            <p>Return... is designed with your privacy in mind. We believe your meditation practice is personal, and your data should stay that way.</p>

            <h2>Apple Health Integration</h2>
            <p>If you enable HealthKit integration, Return... can log your meditation sessions as "Mindful Minutes" to Apple Health. This data:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>

                <li>You can manage or delete this data through your iCloud settings</li>
            </ul>
