Most meditation emphasizes focused attention—concentrate on the breath, a mantra, body sensations. This trains valuable narrow attention. But athletic performance often requires something else: wide, open awareness that takes in the whole field at once.

Open awareness meditation, sometimes called "choiceless awareness" or "receptive awareness," trains exactly this capacity. Instead of focusing on one object, attention opens to include everything—without selecting anything in particular.

## Two Modes of Attention

The brain has two distinct attention modes:

**Focused attention**: Narrow, concentrated, analytical. Looking at a specific thing while excluding everything else. Useful for detailed work, complex thought, specific tasks.

**Open awareness**: Wide, receptive, holistic. Taking in the whole field at once without zeroing in on anything. Useful for detecting movement, sensing environment, and processing complex situations.

Both modes are valuable. Most meditation trains focused attention. Open awareness meditation trains the other mode.

## Why Athletes Need Open Awareness

### Peripheral Vision in Sport

Many sports require simultaneous awareness of multiple elements:

- Soccer: Seeing teammates, opponents, ball, and space simultaneously
- Basketball: Monitoring defenders, potential passes, and shot opportunities
- Combat sports: Tracking opponent's whole body, not fixating on one part
- Team sports generally: Reading formations, anticipating plays, sensing field dynamics

This requires peripheral awareness—soft focus that takes in the whole scene rather than hard focus that narrows to one element.

Athletes who can only focus narrowly miss information. Athletes with trained open awareness see more, react faster, and make better decisions.

### Anticipation and Pattern Recognition

Elite athletes seem to see the future—they're in position before the play develops, they sense what's coming before it happens. This anticipation comes from processing patterns across the whole field.

Pattern recognition requires wide awareness. If you're focused on the ball, you miss the body language that predicts the next move. Open awareness takes in all the information, allowing unconscious pattern matching that feels like intuition.

### Flow State Access

Research on [flow states](/blog/flow-state-meditation-access) shows that peak performance involves a quality of attention that's simultaneously focused and open—concentrated on the task yet aware of everything relevant.

Open awareness training develops the "open" half of this equation. Combined with focused attention practice, it produces the complete attention toolkit that flow requires.

### Stress Response Management

Under pressure, attention tends to narrow. This is the tunnel vision of threat response—focus contracts onto the perceived danger, excluding peripheral information.

For athletes, this narrowing is usually counterproductive. The anxious free throw shooter focuses so narrowly on the rim that they lose awareness of their body. The stressed soccer player fixates on the ball and misses the open teammate.

Open awareness training builds the capacity to resist pressure-induced narrowing. Athletes can maintain wide awareness even when stress would normally collapse it.

## The Practice

### Setting

Open awareness meditation can be done seated or lying down. Some practitioners prefer eyes slightly open (soft gaze, defocused) to support the wide attention quality. Others practice with eyes closed.

A location with some sensory input—sounds, air movement, temperature variation—gives awareness something to open to.

### Basic Instruction

**Settle** (1-2 minutes)
Begin with a few focused breaths to settle. Then relax the focus.

**Open attention**
Instead of focusing on any one thing, let awareness expand to include everything. Don't select anything for special attention. Don't exclude anything either.

Sounds arise—notice them without focusing on them. Body sensations are present—include them without zeroing in. Thoughts appear—notice them without following.

**Maintain openness**
The challenge is maintaining wide attention without collapsing into focus. When you notice you've zeroed in on something (a sound, a thought, a sensation), gently re-open awareness to include everything again.

Think of it as seeing from your whole head rather than through a narrow window. Or sensing the whole room rather than looking at specific objects.

### Duration

Start with 10-15 minutes. Open awareness can be mentally demanding in a different way than focused attention. The practice develops with regular short sessions.

The [Return app](/blog/guide-to-return-meditation-timer) provides quiet timing that doesn't interrupt the open quality of attention.

## Techniques for Opening Awareness

### The Soft Gaze

If practicing with eyes open, use a soft, defocused gaze. Don't look at anything specific. Let vision become receptive rather than active—receiving what's there rather than searching for particular things.

This soft visual quality can extend to other senses as well: soft hearing, soft body awareness.

### Expanding Circles

Begin aware of body sensations. Expand awareness to include the immediate environment. Expand further to include sounds from greater distance. Continue expanding until awareness seems to have no boundaries.

### Dropping the Controller

Instead of directing attention (which always involves selection), imagine you're releasing control. Let attention go wherever it naturally goes, without managing it. This produces a more effortless quality of open awareness.

### Including Everything

When you notice something (a sound, a thought, a sensation), instead of focusing on it, include it in wider awareness. Think "yes, and..." rather than "what's that?" Everything belongs; nothing is excluded or selected.

### The Screen of Awareness

Imagine awareness as a screen on which all experiences appear. Thoughts appear on the screen. Sounds appear. Sensations appear. You're aware of the whole screen, not tracking any particular appearance.

## Common Challenges

### Collapsing into Focus

The habitual pattern is to focus. Awareness repeatedly narrows to something specific. This is normal—it's why the practice is valuable.

When you notice focus has narrowed, simply re-open. This is the training: noticing narrowing and re-opening, repeatedly.

### Falling into Dullness

Open awareness can become vague and drowsy. There's a difference between wide attention (alert, clear, expansive) and dull attention (fuzzy, sleepy, collapsed).

If dullness develops, open the eyes (if closed), adjust posture, take a few energizing breaths, then return to open practice with more clarity.

### Trying Too Hard

Effort often produces focus. The harder you try to be open, the more focused you become. The solution is less effort, not more—allow rather than make.

### Not Knowing If You're Doing It Right

Open awareness is subtle. It lacks the clear object of focused meditation. Uncertainty about whether you're "doing it right" is common.

Trust the practice: if you're intending open awareness and returning to openness when you notice narrowing, you're practicing correctly. The quality develops over time.

## Athletic Applications

### Pre-Competition Opening

Before competition, a brief open awareness practice (5-10 minutes) can set up the wide attention mode that performance requires. It primes the peripheral awareness that focused warm-up activities don't address.

### Between Points/Plays

In sports with pauses (tennis, volleyball, baseball), open awareness practice during these pauses can reset attention. Rather than analyzing the last play or planning the next, simply open awareness to include everything. This clears the mind and prepares for what comes.

### Recovery Integration

Open awareness meditation on recovery days provides mental training that differs from the focused work of performance days. It balances attention training and develops different neural pathways.

### [Pre-Competition Routine](/blog/pre-competition-routines-elite) Component

Include a brief open awareness segment in pre-performance routines. A minute of open attention after focused preparation can produce the optimal attention blend for competition.

## The Attention Toolkit

Elite attention isn't just strong focus—it's flexible attention that can shift between modes as situations require.

**Focused attention** for: analyzing, planning, executing specific techniques, learning new skills, deliberate practice.

**Open awareness** for: monitoring complex environments, reading situations, anticipating, sensing timing, accessing flow.

The complete athlete trains both modes. Most athletes over-train focused attention and neglect open awareness. Adding open awareness practice balances the toolkit.

## Building the Practice

### Start Small

Open awareness can be tiring. Start with 10 minutes and build duration as capacity develops.

### Regular Practice

Brief daily practice produces more benefit than long occasional sessions. Even 5 minutes of open awareness practice maintains and develops the capacity.

### Eyes Open Option

Some athletes prefer eyes-open practice because it's more similar to performance conditions. Experiment with both and notice what works for you.

### Apply During Training

Bring open awareness into training moments. During warm-up, during water breaks, during less intense drills—practice the wide attention mode. This builds transfer to competition.

### Combine with Focused Practice

A complete practice might include focused attention meditation (breath awareness) and open awareness meditation. This trains both modes and develops flexibility between them.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Open awareness is a distinct attention mode** from focused concentration
2. **Athletic performance requires both narrow and wide attention**
3. **Open awareness trains peripheral awareness** and holistic perception
4. **The practice involves allowing attention to include everything** without selecting anything
5. **Pressure tends to narrow attention**—open awareness training resists this
6. **Train both focused and open awareness** for complete attention flexibility
