The diagnosis changes everything. Suddenly your body is a stranger, your future uncertain, your days organized around appointments and treatments. You're navigating a medical world you never wanted to know while processing news you never wanted to receive.

Meditation won't cure your illness. Be skeptical of anyone who claims otherwise. But it can fundamentally change your experience of being ill—reducing suffering, improving quality of life, and helping you live fully in whatever circumstances you face.
