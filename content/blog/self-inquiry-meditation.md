Most meditation observes objects—breath, sensations, thoughts. Self-inquiry does something different: it turns attention toward the observer itself. Instead of watching what arises in consciousness, you investigate who is doing the watching. The question "Who am I?" becomes the practice.

This approach comes primarily from Ramana Maharshi, the 20th-century Indian sage who taught self-inquiry as the most direct path to self-realization. It's deceptively simple and profoundly challenging.

## What Self-Inquiry Is

### The Question

**"Who am I?"**—not as philosophical speculation, but as direct investigation. You're not seeking an answer in words but turning attention toward its source.

**The shift:**
Instead of being interested in the contents of consciousness (thoughts, perceptions), you become interested in consciousness itself—the "I" that knows these contents.

### The Method

**When a thought arises:**
Instead of following the thought, ask: "To whom does this thought arise?"

**The answer:**
"To me." The thought arises to me.

**The inquiry:**
"Who is this 'me'? Who am I?"

**The direction:**
Attention turns from the thought toward the thinker, from the object toward the subject.

### Ramana Maharshi

**The source:**
Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950) taught at Tiruvannamalai in South India. He awakened at age 16 through spontaneous self-inquiry during a death experience, and spent the rest of his life pointing others toward the same investigation.

**His teaching:**
Self-inquiry is the most direct path. All other practices lead eventually to this turning within. Why not start there?

**His method:**
Simple, persistent inquiry. Not complicated. Just keep turning attention toward the I-sense until its source is found.

## The Practice

### Basic Self-Inquiry

**Sit quietly:**
Close your eyes. Let the mind settle somewhat.

**Notice a thought or experience:**
Whatever is arising—a sound, a thought, a sensation.

**Ask:**
"Who is experiencing this? To whom is this arising?"

**Turn attention:**
From the experience toward the experiencer. What is this "I" that knows?

**Hold the inquiry:**
Don't seek an intellectual answer. Hold the question as attention directed toward its own source.

**Repeat:**
When attention wanders to objects (thoughts, perceptions), ask again: "Who is perceiving this?"

### Following the I-Thread

**The I-sense:**
There's a felt sense of "I"—not a thought about I, but the felt sense of being, of existing, of presence.

**The instruction:**
Follow this I-sense back to its source. What is this sense before it becomes "I am this" or "I am that"?

**The direction:**
Attention moves inward, toward the source of awareness, rather than outward toward objects of awareness.

### When Thoughts Arise

**The usual pattern:**
A thought arises; we follow it. We become the thinker, lost in thought.

**The inquiry approach:**
A thought arises. Before following it, ask: "To whom is this thought arising?"

**The turn:**
Instead of moving with the thought, attention turns back toward the one thinking.

### Holding the Question

**Not seeking answers:**
You're not trying to figure out who you are intellectually. That would be another thought.

**The quality:**
Holding open inquiry. Curious attention directed at its own source. Waiting, receptive, alert.

**What happens:**
At first, nothing. The mind wants to provide answers ("I'm my thoughts," "I'm my body," "I'm awareness"). These are still thoughts. Keep inquiring: "Who knows this? Who am I?"

## What You're Investigating

### The Assumed Self

**The usual sense:**
We assume we know what "I" is—the body, the mind, the personality, the history.

**The inquiry:**
Is this true? Are you really these things, or are these things known by something prior?

**The investigation:**
Looking directly rather than assuming.

### Thoughts Are Not Self

**The observation:**
Thoughts come and go. They arise without your choosing them. They pass away.

**The inquiry:**
If thoughts are observed, can you be the thoughts? What observes them?

### Body Is Not Self

**The observation:**
You're aware of the body. You know its sensations. You watch it change over decades.

**The inquiry:**
If the body is observed, are you the body, or are you what observes it?

### The Witness

**The apparent finding:**
It seems there's a witness—an observing awareness that watches everything.

**The further inquiry:**
But is this witness separate from what it witnesses? Is there really a "someone" witnessing? Who is this witness?

**Going deeper:**
Self-inquiry doesn't stop at "I am the witness." It inquires into the witness itself.

### The Source

**What's pointed to:**
Before the sense "I am," before any identification, before any thought—what is there?

**The direction:**
Inquiry leads toward the source of the I-sense, the origin of the sense of being.

**What tradition says:**
This source is found to be pure awareness—not aware of something, but awareness itself. And this is not different from your true nature.

## Common Challenges

### The Mind Wants Answers

**The problem:**
The mind supplies answers: "I am awareness. I am consciousness. I am nothing." These become new concepts.

**The response:**
Any answer is still a thought. Who knows this answer? Keep inquiring past answers.

### Feeling Like Nothing Is Happening

**The experience:**
You ask "Who am I?" and just sit there. Nothing special occurs.

**The teaching:**
This is fine. The inquiry is in the asking, the turning. Results come in their own time. Persistent practice matters.

### Getting Philosophical

**The trap:**
Self-inquiry becomes intellectual: reading about non-duality, debating definitions, collecting concepts.

**The correction:**
Return to direct inquiry. Not thoughts about self, but direct looking at who is thinking.

### Confusion About What to Do

**The uncertainty:**
"Am I doing this right? What am I supposed to be experiencing?"

**The simplicity:**
Just keep asking. Turn attention toward its source. That's the whole practice. Don't complicate it.

### Frustration

**The feeling:**
"I've been asking and nothing is happening."

**The perspective:**
This can take years. Don't expect rapid results. The inquiry works slowly, gradually undermining false identification.

## Signs of Progress

### Increased Awareness of Thoughts

**The change:**
You notice thoughts arising more quickly. There's less automatic identification with mental content.

**The meaning:**
Inquiry is creating space between awareness and objects of awareness.

### Glimpses of Space

**The experience:**
Moments where the question dissolves into stillness. Brief gaps in the usual mental chatter.

**The meaning:**
The inquiry is working. These glimpses may deepen with continued practice.

### Decreased Suffering

**The change:**
Problems feel less personal, less solid. There's more equanimity.

**The meaning:**
The false self—the one who suffers—is becoming less convincing.

### Shift in Identity

**The change:**
A growing sense that you're not what you thought you were. Less certainty about "I" as a specific thing.

**The meaning:**
The investigation is destabilizing fixed self-concept. This is the point.

## Self-Inquiry and Other Practices

### Relationship to Other Meditation

**The difference:**
Most meditation observes objects within consciousness. Self-inquiry investigates the subject.

**The complement:**
Object-focused meditation can develop concentration that supports inquiry. Inquiry can deepen what concentration reveals.

### For Advanced Practitioners

**The recommendation:**
Some teachers suggest developing stable attention (through breath meditation or similar) before intensive self-inquiry. Others say start with inquiry directly.

**The assessment:**
If inquiry just leads to more thinking, more concentration work may help. If you can hold the question without spinning into concepts, proceed with inquiry.

### In the Advaita Tradition

**The view:**
Self-inquiry is seen as the most direct path in Advaita Vedanta. Other practices prepare for it or are less direct routes to the same goal.

**The claim:**
All paths eventually lead to investigation of the self. Self-inquiry starts there.

## Beginning Practice

### A Simple Session

**Sit quietly:**
10-20 minutes to start.

**Settle:**
A few breaths, let the mind quiet somewhat.

**Begin inquiry:**
When a thought arises, ask: "To whom is this thought?"
Answer: "To me."
Ask: "Who am I?"

**Turn attention:**
From the thought to the thinker. What is this "I"?

**Hold the question:**
Not seeking mental answers. Just holding open inquiry, attention turned toward itself.

**Continue:**
Each time attention wanders to objects, ask again: "Who is perceiving this?"

### Building Practice

**Daily:**
Regular practice develops the inquiry muscle. Even short sessions maintain contact with the investigation.

**Throughout the day:**
"Who is experiencing this?" can be asked anytime—in activity, in rest, in difficulty.

**Study:**
Reading Ramana Maharshi's teachings (such as "Who Am I?" and "Talks with Ramana Maharshi") provides guidance and inspiration.

## The Direct Path

Self-inquiry is radical because it goes directly to the source. Instead of working with objects in consciousness, it investigates consciousness itself. Instead of assuming we know who we are and working from there, it questions that assumption fundamentally.

The question "Who am I?" has been asked by seekers for millennia. Not to find an answer in words, but to find what can't be captured in words—your own nature before all identification.
