You train your body with coaches. You develop skills through practice. But when it comes to your mind—the tool that ultimately determines how you perform under pressure—many athletes have never worked with a professional.

Sports psychologists specialize in the mental side of athletics. Understanding what they do, how to find one, and how to maximize the relationship can accelerate your development significantly. Here's what every athlete should know.

## What Sports Psychologists Do

### Performance Enhancement

Core mental skills work:

**Focus training**: Developing attention control for competition

**Arousal regulation**: Managing energy levels for optimal performance

**Confidence building**: Strengthening self-belief and resilience

**Visualization**: [Mental rehearsal](/blog/mental-rehearsal-visualization-athletes) techniques

**Routine development**: [Pre-competition](/blog/pre-competition-routines-elite) and within-competition routines

**Pressure management**: [Performing under stress](/blog/clutch-state-performance-pressure)

This is the skill-building side—training mental capacities like you train physical ones.

### Clinical Issues

When athletes face mental health challenges:

**Anxiety and depression**: Clinical-level issues affecting life and sport

**Eating disorders**: Particularly relevant in weight-class and aesthetic sports

**Substance issues**: Performance and recreational substances

**Trauma processing**: Including injury-related psychological damage

**Identity concerns**: Life transitions, career endings, identity crises

This is the clinical side—treating psychological issues that impair wellbeing.

### The Distinction

Performance enhancement specialists (mental performance consultants, mental skills coaches) focus on developing skills. Licensed psychologists can also address clinical issues.

Know what you need:
- Building mental skills for performance → Either can help
- Managing clinical issues (anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders) → Licensed psychologist required

## Who Can Help

### Licensed Psychologists

**Education**: Doctoral degree (PhD or PsyD) in psychology

**Licensing**: State-licensed, requiring supervised clinical hours

**Scope**: Can diagnose and treat mental health conditions

**Sports specialization**: Additional training in sport and performance

**Titles**: Sport Psychologist, Clinical Sport Psychologist

### Mental Performance Consultants

**Education**: Often master's degree in sport psychology or related field

**Certification**: CMPC (Certified Mental Performance Consultant) or similar

**Scope**: Performance enhancement and skill building; cannot treat clinical conditions

**Approach**: Focused on performance optimization

**Titles**: Mental Performance Consultant, Mental Skills Coach, Performance Consultant

### Other Professionals

**Clinical psychologists**: May not have sport-specific training but address clinical issues

**Counselors and therapists**: Can address mental health but may lack sport expertise

**Coaches with training**: Some coaches have mental skills knowledge

**Meditation/mindfulness teachers**: Can teach foundational practices

The right choice depends on your needs. Performance issues with no clinical component? Mental performance consultant works. Significant anxiety or depression? Need a licensed psychologist.

## Finding the Right Fit

### Assess Your Needs

Before searching:

**Performance focus**: What mental skills do you want to develop?

**Clinical concerns**: Are there mental health issues that need addressing?

**Sport specificity**: How important is experience in your specific sport?

**Access**: In-person, virtual, or both?

### Sources for Finding Professionals

**Sport organizations**: Many national governing bodies maintain directories

**AASP directory**: Association for Applied Sport Psychology's find-a-consultant tool

**Team/school resources**: Athletic departments often have or can refer

**Other athletes**: Recommendations from peers who've worked with someone

**Insurance networks**: If cost is a factor and you have mental health coverage

### Questions to Ask

When evaluating potential professionals:

**Background**:
- What's your training and education?
- Are you licensed? (If clinical needs exist)
- What certifications do you hold?
- Do you have experience with [my sport]?

**Approach**:
- How do you typically work with athletes?
- What does a typical session look like?
- Do you assign "homework" or practice between sessions?
- How do you measure progress?

**Practical**:
- What are your fees?
- Do you accept insurance? (For licensed psychologists)
- How often would we meet?
- What's your availability?

### The Fit Factor

Beyond credentials, consider:

**Rapport**: Do you feel comfortable with them?

**Communication style**: Does their approach match your learning style?

**Athletic understanding**: Do they "get" the athlete experience?

**Accessibility**: Can you actually work with them given logistics?

Trust your gut. The relationship matters as much as the credentials.

## What to Expect

### Initial Sessions

First meeting typically includes:

**Information gathering**: Your background, sport, goals, challenges

**Assessment**: Formal or informal evaluation of current mental skills

**Goal setting**: Identifying priorities for your work together

**Explanation**: How the process will work

**Questions**: Opportunity to ask about their approach

You're assessing fit as much as they're assessing you.

### Ongoing Work

Regular sessions often involve:

**Skill introduction**: Learning new mental techniques

**Practice and refinement**: Working on skills during sessions

**Application planning**: How to use skills in training and competition

**Review**: What's working, what isn't, what needs adjustment

**Support**: Processing challenges, setbacks, breakthroughs

Sessions might be weekly, bi-weekly, or variable based on need and schedule.

### Between Sessions

The real work happens between meetings:

**Practice assignments**: Mental skills to work on during training

**Journaling or tracking**: Recording experiences and observations

**Application**: Using techniques in training and competition

**Reflection**: Noting what's working and what questions arise

Mental training without practice between sessions is like physical training once a week—insufficient.

### Timeline Expectations

Mental skill development takes time:

**Initial phase** (1-3 months): Learning basics, establishing routine

**Development phase** (3-6 months): Deepening skills, applying to competition

**Integration phase** (6+ months): Skills becoming natural, refining

**Ongoing**: Maintenance, addressing new challenges, continued growth

Quick fixes don't exist. Expect sustained effort for sustained change.

## Maximizing the Experience

### Be Honest

Vulnerability enables progress:

**About struggles**: Share what's actually challenging

**About doubts**: Express skepticism or uncertainty

**About life context**: Sport happens within life; relevant context matters

**About the process**: If something isn't working, say so

The professional can only help with what you share.

### Do the Work

Practice matters:

**Complete assignments**: Actually do the between-session work

**Apply in training**: Use techniques during practice, not just in sessions

**Track and reflect**: Notice what happens when you practice

**Be consistent**: Regular practice beats occasional intensity

### Ask Questions

Understanding enhances application:

**Why this technique?**: Understand the purpose

**How does it work?**: Grasp the mechanism

**What should I notice?**: Know what success looks like

**What if it's not working?**: Have troubleshooting approaches

### Be Patient

Change takes time:

**Skill development is gradual**: Like physical training, mental training compounds

**Not every technique fits**: Some approaches will work better than others

**Performance fluctuation**: Progress isn't linear

**Trust the process**: Sustained effort yields results

### Integrate with Other Training

Mental training works with physical training:

**Communicate with coaches**: Share what you're working on if appropriate

**Apply during training**: Use mental skills in practice

**Connect approaches**: Mental and physical training should complement

**Build into routine**: Make mental training as habitual as physical training

## Cost and Access

### Cost Considerations

Mental performance services cost:

**Private practice**: $100-300+ per session typically

**Team/school services**: Often covered by athletic program

**Insurance**: Some licensed psychologists take insurance; coverage varies

**Sliding scale**: Some professionals offer reduced rates based on need

View it as investment in development, comparable to coaching and equipment.

### Access Challenges

Common barriers and solutions:

**Cost**: Explore team resources, insurance, sliding scale options

**Location**: Virtual sessions have become standard and effective

**Time**: Work with professional to find sustainable schedule

**Finding someone**: Use directories, ask for referrals, be persistent

### Self-Directed Alternatives

When professional support isn't accessible:

**Apps and programs**: Guided mental training like Return

**Books**: Mental training literature written for athletes

**Courses**: Online learning for mental skills

**Coach support**: Some coaches have mental training knowledge

These don't replace professional support but can provide foundation.

## When to Seek Help

### Performance Indicators

Consider professional support when:

- Performance significantly below capabilities under pressure
- Same mental mistakes recurring despite awareness
- Confidence issues affecting training and competition
- Focus problems that aren't improving with self-work
- Major transition (injury, level change, career ending)

### Clinical Indicators

Definitely seek licensed professional when:

- Persistent anxiety affecting daily life
- Depression symptoms (low mood, loss of interest, sleep issues)
- Eating or body image concerns
- Substance use concerns
- Traumatic experiences affecting function
- Thoughts of self-harm

These require clinical expertise, not just mental skills coaching.

### Proactive Approach

You don't need a crisis:

- Building mental skills before problems arise
- Developing resilience for future challenges
- Optimizing already-good performance
- Preparing for high-pressure situations ahead

The best time to start is before you desperately need help.

## Working Within Teams

### Team-Provided Services

Many athletic programs offer mental performance support:

**Access**: Usually free for athletes

**Integration**: Professional understands team context

**Convenience**: Often on-site or easily accessible

**Limitation**: May have less choice in who you work with

### Confidentiality Considerations

Understand boundaries:

**What's shared with coaches**: Ask directly about policies

**Your control**: You typically control what gets communicated

**Emergency exceptions**: Safety concerns override confidentiality

**Documentation**: Understand what records are kept

### Seeking Outside Help

When team services don't fit:

**If you want more choice**: Different style or approach preferred

**If you need specialized help**: Team professional may not have expertise you need

**If confidentiality concerns exist**: Completely independent relationship

**If access is limited**: Team resources insufficient for your needs

You're not obligated to use only team-provided services.

## Common Misconceptions

### "It's Only for Struggling Athletes"

Reality: Elite athletes use mental performance support to optimize, not just fix problems.

### "It's Like Therapy"

Reality: Mental performance work focuses on skill building, though it can include therapeutic elements.

### "It's Quick Fixes"

Reality: Mental skills develop over time like physical skills.

### "It's a Sign of Weakness"

Reality: It's a sign of taking performance seriously.

### "Results Should Be Immediate"

Reality: Expect gradual improvement over months of consistent work.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Know the difference** between performance enhancement and clinical work—your needs determine who to work with
2. **Find good fit**—credentials matter, but so does rapport and communication style
3. **Expect a process**—initial assessment, ongoing skill work, and practice between sessions
4. **Do the work**—what happens between sessions matters most
5. **Be honest**—the professional can only help with what you share
6. **Be patient**—mental skill development takes sustained effort over time
7. **Start proactively**—don't wait for crisis to seek support
