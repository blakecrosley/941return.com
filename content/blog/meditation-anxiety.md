Your chest is tight. Your mind is racing through worst-case scenarios. You know, intellectually, that most of what you're worried about won't happen. But knowing doesn't stop the anxiety. It runs its own program, hijacking your body and mind regardless of logic.

Meditation has solid evidence for anxiety reduction. But it's not magic, and not all approaches work equally well. Here's what actually helps, what to be careful about, and how to build a practice that makes a real difference.

## Understanding Anxiety and the Mind

### What Anxiety Is

**The system:**
Anxiety is the threat detection system working overtime.

**The purpose:**
Originally adaptive—kept ancestors alive.

**The problem:**

### The Body Component

**The physical:**

**The experience:**

**The approach:**
Working with the body, not just the mind.

### The Mind Component

Worry, catastrophizing, rumination, planning for disaster.

**The pattern:**
Future-focused; things that might go wrong.

**The trap:**
Engaging with anxious thoughts feeds them.

### The Avoidance Pattern

**The behavior:**
Avoiding what triggers anxiety.

**The short-term:**
Relief.

**The long-term:**
Avoidance strengthens anxiety.

## How Meditation Helps

**The mechanism:**
Regular practice reduces chronic nervous system activation.

Noticing anxiety in the body before it escalates.

**The intervention:**
Early response is more effective.

Developed through body-focused practice.

## Effective Practices

## The Bottom Line

Anxiety is the threat detection system gone haywire. Meditation addresses this through:

- Developing body awareness

Meditation won't eliminate anxiety. But it can change your relationship with it—from hijacked to observant, from overwhelmed to capable. That change is worth pursuing.
