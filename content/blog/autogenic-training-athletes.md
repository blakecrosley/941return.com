"My right arm is heavy." You repeat the phrase silently, and gradually your arm actually feels heavier. This isn't imagination—it's autogenic training, a technique that uses verbal self-suggestion to produce measurable physical changes.

Developed in Germany in the 1930s and used extensively in sports psychology since, autogenic training gives athletes a method for deliberately creating internal states that support performance and recovery.

## What Is Autogenic Training?

### The Basics

Autogenic training explained:

**Autogenic**: Self-generating or self-produced

**The method**: Repeating specific verbal formulas to produce physical effects

**The mechanism**: Mind-body connection activated through focused self-suggestion

**The states produced**: Heaviness, warmth, calm heartbeat, easy breathing

**The goal**: Deep relaxation and physiological self-regulation

### How It Works

The mechanism of autogenic training:

**Verbal suggestion**: Phrases activate physical responses

**Attention focus**: Concentrated attention on body sensations

**Passive concentration**: Effortless allowing rather than forcing

**Conditioned response**: Regular practice strengthens the connection

**Measurable effects**: Studies show actual physiological changes

### History and Research

Where autogenic training comes from:

**Developer**: Johannes Schultz, German psychiatrist, 1932

**Evolution**: Refined and systematized over decades

**Research base**: Extensive European studies, sport psychology applications

**Athletic use**: Common in German and Eastern European sport programs

**Modern application**: Still taught by sports psychologists worldwide

## The Standard Formulas

### The Six Core Phrases

Traditional autogenic training uses:

1. **Heaviness**: "My right arm is heavy" (then left arm, legs, whole body)
2. **Warmth**: "My right arm is warm" (then left arm, legs, whole body)
3. **Calm heart**: "My heartbeat is calm and regular"
4. **Easy breathing**: "My breathing is calm and easy" (or "It breathes me")
5. **Warm abdomen**: "My solar plexus is warm"
6. **Cool forehead**: "My forehead is cool"

### Progression Through Formulas

How to learn the sequence:

**Week 1-2**: Heaviness formula only

**Week 3-4**: Add warmth formula

**Week 5-6**: Add calm heart

**Week 7-8**: Add easy breathing

**Week 9-10**: Add warm abdomen

**Week 11-12**: Add cool forehead

**Ongoing**: Full sequence or abbreviated versions

### Why This Sequence

The logic of the formulas:

**Heaviness**: Releases muscular tension; foundation for relaxation

**Warmth**: Vasodilation, blood flow; deepens relaxation

**Calm heart**: Cardiovascular calming; reduces anxiety

**Easy breathing**: Respiratory ease; further calming

**Warm abdomen**: Digestive calming; core relaxation

**Cool forehead**: Mental clarity; alertness within calm

## How to Practice

### Basic Session Structure

A typical autogenic training session:

**Position**: Reclined or sitting, supported

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes initially

**Environment**: Quiet, comfortable temperature

**Mindset**: Passive concentration—allowing, not forcing

### The Practice Method

For each formula:

1. **Close eyes**: Reduce external distraction
2. **State the formula**: Silently repeat (e.g., "My right arm is heavy")
3. **Focus attention**: Notice the sensation in that area
4. **Passive awareness**: Let the sensation develop naturally
5. **Repeat**: Continue the formula 3-6 times
6. **Allow**: Don't force; let the body respond
7. **Move to next**: Progress through the formulas

### Ending the Session

Proper return to activity:

**Don't jump up**: Transition gradually

**Flex and stretch**: Move limbs gently

**Open eyes**: Reorient to surroundings

**Take breath**: Deep breath before standing

**Standard phrase**: "I am calm and alert" or "I feel refreshed"

### Common Pitfalls

What interferes with success:

**Trying too hard**: Forcing rather than allowing

**Expecting immediate results**: This takes practice

**Incomplete formulas**: Skipping ahead before mastering basics

**No regular practice**: Inconsistency prevents development

**Wrong environment**: Practicing in noisy or uncomfortable settings

## Athletic Applications

### Pre-Competition

Autogenic training before performance:

**Timing**: 30-60 minutes before competition

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes or abbreviated version

**Focus**: Calm arousal to optimal level

**Transition**: From autogenic training to [pre-game routine](/blog/pre-competition-routines-elite)

**Effect**: Reduced anxiety, optimal arousal, physical readiness

### Recovery Enhancement

Autogenic training for recovery:

**Post-training**: Full session after training

**Sleep enhancement**: Before bed for better sleep. See [sleep and meditation](/blog/sleep-architecture-meditation-recovery).

**Injury recovery**: Supports healing process

**Overtraining prevention**: Parasympathetic activation

### Performance State Creation

Beyond relaxation:

**Adapted formulas**: Can modify for activation ("My arms are light and powerful")

**Energy formulas**: "I am full of energy" or "I am ready to perform"

**Sport-specific**: Tailored phrases for your activity

**Post-autogenic visualization**: Deep relaxation enhances [mental rehearsal](/blog/mental-rehearsal-visualization-athletes)

### During Competition

Limited but possible application:

**Between events**: Full or abbreviated session if time allows

**Brief centering**: Single formula for quick reset

**Timeout utilization**: Quick calming during stoppages

**Post-competition**: Recovery session after competing

## Modified Approaches for Athletes

### Abbreviated Protocols

Shorter versions for time-limited contexts:

**Quick version (2-3 minutes)**:
- Heaviness and warmth combined for whole body
- One formula for heartbeat/breathing
- Brief return

**Competition-ready (1 minute)**:
- "My body is heavy and warm"
- "My heartbeat and breathing are calm"
- Return phrase

### Active-Alert Variation

For performance rather than deep relaxation:

**Standard formulas first**: Create the base calm

**Activation formulas added**: "I am alert and ready" or "My muscles are ready to perform"

**Energy phrases**: "I have all the energy I need"

**Sport-specific**: "My swing is smooth and powerful"

### Sport-Specific Adaptations

Tailored formulas:

**Runners**: "My legs are light and powerful"

**Golfers**: "My grip is relaxed and secure"

**Shooters**: "My trigger finger is calm and precise"

**Combat sports**: "I am calm, alert, and powerful"

## Comparison with Related Techniques

### Autogenic vs. PMR

Two relaxation approaches:

**[PMR](/blog/progressive-muscle-relaxation-guide)**: Active tensing and releasing

**Autogenic**: Passive suggestion without muscular action

**PMR better for**: Learning tension awareness, active engagement

**Autogenic better for**: Deep relaxation, physiological self-regulation

**Both together**: Can complement each other

### Autogenic vs. Meditation

Related but distinct:

**Meditation**: Broad category including many methods

**Autogenic**: Specific technique with set formulas

**Overlap**: Both produce relaxation and mental quiet

**Difference**: Autogenic specifically targets physical states

### Autogenic vs. Visualization

Different purposes:

**Autogenic**: Creates internal physical states

**[Visualization](/blog/mental-rehearsal-visualization-athletes)**: Mentally rehearses performance

**Sequence**: Often autogenic first, then visualization

**Complementary**: Relaxed body improves visualization quality

## Building Your Practice

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-6)

Learning the basics:

**Heaviness only (Week 1-2)**: Master the foundation

**Add warmth (Week 3-4)**: Expand the practice

**Add calm heart (Week 5-6)**: Deepen the sequence

**Daily practice**: 10-15 minutes, same time each day

### Phase 2: Completion (Weeks 7-12)

Completing the sequence:

**Add breathing (Week 7-8)**: Respiratory formula

**Add warm abdomen (Week 9-10)**: Core relaxation

**Add cool forehead (Week 11-12)**: Full sequence

**Regular practice**: Continue daily

### Phase 3: Application (Ongoing)

Athletic integration:

**Competition use**: Apply to pre-competition routines

**Recovery use**: Post-training sessions

**Abbreviated versions**: Quick protocols for limited time

**Modifications**: Sport-specific adaptations

## Measuring Progress

### Subjective Indicators

How to know it's working:

**Sensation development**: Feeling heaviness, warmth more clearly

**Depth of relaxation**: Deeper states achieved more quickly

**Generalization**: Sensations spread from arm to whole body

**After-effects**: Calm persists after session

### Objective Indicators

Measurable changes:

**Heart rate**: Reduced during and after practice

**Skin temperature**: Increased (due to vasodilation from warmth formula)

**Muscle tension**: Reduced (measurable with EMG)

**HRV**: Improved heart rate variability. See [HRV and performance](/blog/hrv-biomarker-performance).

## Key Takeaways

1. **Autogenic training uses verbal formulas**—specific phrases produce physical states
2. **Passive concentration**—allow rather than force the sensations
3. **Progressive learning**—add one formula at a time over weeks
4. **Regular practice required**—daily sessions build the response
5. **Athletic applications**—pre-competition calming, recovery enhancement
6. **Adaptable**—abbreviated versions and sport-specific modifications
7. **Complements other practices**—works well with PMR, visualization, meditation
