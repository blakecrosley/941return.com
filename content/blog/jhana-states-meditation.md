The jhanas are states of deep meditative absorption that most meditators have heard of but few have experienced. Described in Buddhist texts for millennia, they represent profound concentration that goes beyond ordinary meditation into altered states of consciousness.

Are jhanas real? Essential? Just for monks? Here's what you should know about these distinctive meditative states.

## What Are Jhanas?

### The Basic Definition

**The word:**
Jhana (Pali) or Dhyana (Sanskrit)—means absorption or meditation.

**The state:**
Deep concentration where ordinary thinking subsides and distinct qualities arise.

**The experience:**
Qualitatively different from everyday consciousness.

### The Traditional Count

**The form jhanas:**
Four primary absorptions (sometimes further divided).

**The formless jhanas:**
Four additional, more refined states.

**The progression:**
Each builds on the previous.

### What They're Not

**Not trance:**
You remain aware and lucid.

**Not unconsciousness:**
Consciousness is heightened, not diminished.

**Not visualization:**
Not imagined states—experientially distinct.

**Not necessary for insight:**
Different practitioners emphasize them differently.

## The Four Form Jhanas

### First Jhana

**The entry:**
Concentration stabilizes; mind becomes unified.

**The characteristics:**
- Applied attention (vitakka)—directing mind to object
- Sustained attention (vicara)—maintaining contact
- Rapture (piti)—energetic pleasure, sometimes physical
- Happiness (sukha)—contentment, ease
- One-pointedness (ekaggata)—unified attention

**The experience:**
Pleasurable concentration with some mental activity still present. Joy and rapture are pronounced.

**The analogy:**
Like discovering an oasis after walking through desert.

### Second Jhana

**The shift:**
Applied and sustained attention fade.

**What remains:**
- Rapture
- Happiness
- One-pointedness

**The experience:**
Stiller than first jhana. Less effort required. Rapture prominent without the work of directing attention.

**The analogy:**
Like a spring-fed pool—joy wells up from within without effort.

### Third Jhana

**The shift:**
Rapture fades.

**What remains:**
- Happiness (more subtle, peaceful)
- One-pointedness
- Equanimity begins

**The experience:**
Deeper calm. The energetic pleasure of rapture settles into peaceful contentment. Equanimous happiness.

**The analogy:**
Like lotus flowers in cool water—immersed in peace.

### Fourth Jhana

**The shift:**
Happiness transforms into pure equanimity.

**What remains:**
- Equanimity (upekkha)
- One-pointedness
- Neither pleasure nor pain

**The experience:**
Profound stillness. Utterly balanced awareness. Breath may become very subtle or seem to stop.

**The analogy:**
Like being wrapped in white cloth—complete purification of awareness.

## The Formless Jhanas

### Beyond Form

**The territory:**
After mastering fourth jhana, attention can shift to increasingly refined objects.

**The progression:**
Each state transcends the previous.

**The subtlety:**
Increasingly difficult to describe in words.

### Fifth Jhana: Infinite Space

**The shift:**
Attention moves from breath/body to boundless space.

**The experience:**
Sense of infinite extension in all directions.

**The object:**
Space itself, without limit.

### Sixth Jhana: Infinite Consciousness

**The shift:**
From space to the consciousness knowing space.

**The experience:**
Awareness of boundless awareness.

**The object:**
Consciousness itself, infinite.

### Seventh Jhana: Nothingness

**The shift:**
Even infinite consciousness releases.

**The experience:**
Absence of anything to perceive.

**The object:**
The absence of anything.

### Eighth Jhana: Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception

**The shift:**
Even nothingness is too gross.

**The experience:**
Almost impossible to describe—perception so refined it barely registers.

**The object:**
At the edge of consciousness itself.

## How to Access Jhana

### Prerequisites

**Strong concentration:**
Ability to stay with object for extended periods.

**Relaxation:**
Tension blocks absorption.

**Interest:**
Genuine engagement with the meditation object.

**Letting go:**
Not trying too hard.

### The Process

**1. Establish access concentration:**
Mind settles, distractions fade, attention steady.

**2. Notice pleasant sensations:**
Joy or comfort that arises with concentration.

**3. Incline toward pleasure:**
Let attention rest on the pleasant feeling itself.

**4. Allow absorption:**
Stop efforting. Let the state take over.

**5. Surrender:**
You don't do jhana; you allow it.

### Common Approaches

**The Visuddhimagga approach:**
Very precise definitions, hard to achieve, rare states.

**The sutta approach:**
Lighter criteria, more accessible, some debate about authenticity.

**Modern teachers:**
Various interpretations of what counts as jhana.

### What Helps

**Longer sits:**
Jhana typically requires more than 20 minutes.

**Retreat conditions:**
Reduced stimulation, more time for depth.

**Teacher guidance:**
Someone who has experienced states can point the way.

**Patience:**
May take years to access reliably.

### What Hinders

**Trying too hard:**
Effort blocks the letting go required.

**Wanting jhana:**
Desire itself prevents absorption.

**Doubt:**
"Is this it?" kicks you out.

**Restlessness:**
Can't absorb when agitated.

**Sleepiness:**
Need alertness for jhana, not drowsiness.

## Different Interpretations

### The Controversy

**The debate:**
What exactly qualifies as jhana?

**The spectrum:**
From very strict to quite inclusive interpretations.

**The stakes:**
Who has "really" achieved jhana?

### The Strict Interpretation

**The claim:**
True jhana is rare, requires extensive training.

**The criteria:**
No body awareness, no sense of time, complete absorption.

**The source:**
Visuddhimagga (5th century commentary).

### The Lite Interpretation

**The claim:**
Jhana is more accessible than often taught.

**The criteria:**
Stable attention with jhana factors present.

**The source:**
Direct reading of suttas, some modern teachers.

### The Practical View

**The approach:**
Don't worry about whether it's "real" jhana.

**The focus:**
Is your concentration developing? Are qualities present?

**The priority:**
Experience matters more than labels.
