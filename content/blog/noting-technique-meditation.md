A thought arises: "What if I lose tomorrow?" Instead of following it into a spiral of worry, you silently note: "Worrying." Then return your attention to the present. Another thought: "I should have trained harder." Note: "Judging." Return again.

This is the noting technique—a meditation method that uses simple labels to recognize mental activity without getting lost in it. For athletes, it's a tool for developing awareness of the thought patterns that affect performance.

## What Is Noting?

### The Basic Method

Noting explained:

**Recognition**: Notice when attention has shifted

**Label**: Apply a brief, neutral word to what's happening

**Return**: Gently bring attention back to the present

**Repeat**: Continue this process throughout meditation

**Skill development**: Over time, recognition becomes faster

### Types of Notes

What you might label:

**Thinking**: General thought activity

**Planning**: Future-focused thinking

**Worrying**: Anxious thoughts

**Remembering**: Past-focused thinking

**Judging**: Evaluative thoughts

**Fantasizing**: Imaginative thinking

**Feeling**: Emotions (anger, sadness, joy)

**Sensing**: Physical sensations (itching, tension, warmth)

### How It Works

The mechanism of noting:

**Creates distance**: The label separates you from the content

**Prevents absorption**: Noting interrupts getting lost in thoughts

**Builds awareness**: You learn your patterns

**Develops equanimity**: All experience becomes "noteable," equally

**Strengthens attention**: The return is the exercise

## Why Noting Works for Athletes

### Pattern Recognition

Seeing your mental tendencies:

**Common loops identified**: What thoughts repeat?

**Trigger awareness**: What starts negative spirals?

**Pre-competition patterns**: Specific thoughts before games

**In-competition thinking**: What happens during performance?

**Recovery patterns**: How you think after wins and losses

### Thought Distancing

Creating space from mental content:

**Not believing every thought**: A thought is just a thought

**Not following every impulse**: Space between stimulus and response

**Reduced rumination**: See [mental recovery after loss](/blog/mental-recovery-after-loss)

**Less catastrophizing**: Thoughts are events, not predictions

### Present-Moment Return

Training the attention return:

**Each note is a return**: Practice for competition

**Quick recovery**: Getting back on track faster

**Refocusing skill**: Applicable during performance

**Automatic development**: Eventually noting happens naturally

## How to Practice

### Basic Noting Meditation

Standard practice:

1. **Sit comfortably**: Stable position, alert posture
2. **Close eyes**: Reduce external distraction
3. **Focus on breath**: Or another anchor (body, sounds)
4. **When distracted**: Note what distracted you
5. **Use simple label**: One or two words, neutral tone
6. **Return to anchor**: Gently, without self-criticism
7. **Continue**: 10-20 minutes

### Label Types

How specific to be:

**General labels**: "Thinking," "feeling," "sensing"

**Specific labels**: "Planning," "worrying," "anger," "itching"

**Recommendation**: Start general, add specificity as helpful

**Don't overthink**: The label should be quick, not analyzed

### Tone and Attitude

How to note:

**Neutral**: Like a scientist observing

**Gentle**: Not critical or frustrated

**Brief**: One word, then return

**Quiet**: Internal whisper, not forceful

**Non-judgmental**: "Worrying" is just a label, not a problem

## Advanced Noting

### Faster Noting

Increasing frequency:

**Continuous noting**: Label everything that arises

**Rapid labels**: Quick succession of notes

**Detailed awareness**: Nothing escapes observation

**Advanced practice**: For experienced meditators only

### Bodily Noting

Focusing on physical experience:

**Rising/falling**: Note breath movement

**Sitting/touching**: Note body contact with surface

**Hearing/seeing**: Note sensory experience

**Tension/relaxation**: Note muscular states

**Connection to [body scan](/blog/body-scan-meditation-athletes)**: Related practices

### Emotional Noting

Working with feelings:

**Identify the emotion**: What is this feeling?

**Note its qualities**: Intensity, location, movement

**Note its impermanence**: Watch it change

**Application**: Emotional regulation through awareness

## Athletic Applications

### Pre-Competition

Noting before performance:

**Notice anxiety thoughts**: "Worrying," "catastrophizing"

**Notice excitement**: "Anticipating," "excitement"

**Notice self-doubt**: "Doubting," "comparing"

**Create distance**: These are just thoughts

**Return to preparation**: Focus on [pre-game routine](/blog/pre-competition-routines-elite)

### During Competition

Noting in action:

**Simplified version**: Note only when clearly distracted

**Quick labels**: "Thinking" or "past" or "future"

**Immediate return**: Back to task

**[Clutch moments](/blog/clutch-free-throws-mental)**: Note anxiety, return to routine

**Mistakes**: Note "judging," return to next play

### Post-Competition

Noting after performance:

**Victory patterns**: What thoughts arise when you win?

**Defeat patterns**: What thoughts arise when you lose?

**Learning opportunity**: Notice without judgment

**[Recovery from loss](/blog/mental-recovery-after-loss)**: Note thoughts, don't get lost in them

### Training Integration

Noting during training:

**Fatigue thoughts**: "Tired," "stopping"

**Motivation thoughts**: "Bored," "wanting to quit"

**Comparison thoughts**: "Judging," "comparing"

**Return to effort**: After noting, back to training

## Common Challenges

### Labeling Everything

Over-noting problem:

**Issue**: Constant noting becomes exhausting

**Solution**: Note only when clearly distracted

**Balance**: Anchor is primary; noting is when you've drifted

**Guidance**: Less is often more

### Getting Lost in Labels

Thinking about the notes:

**Issue**: "Am I using the right label?"

**Solution**: Any label is fine; the return matters

**Simplify**: "Thinking" covers most things

**Don't analyze**: Note quickly, return immediately

### Frustration with Frequency

Too many distractions:

**Issue**: "I'm noting constantly; I can't focus"

**Response**: That's normal, especially at first

**Perspective**: Every note is practice

**Improvement**: Frequency decreases over time

### Self-Criticism

Judging the noting:

**Issue**: "I'm so distracted; I'm terrible at this"

**Solution**: Note "judging" and return

**Irony**: The criticism is more thinking to note

**Attitude**: Noticing distraction IS the practice

## Building Your Practice

### Beginner Phase (Weeks 1-4)

Learning the technique:

**Session length**: 10 minutes daily

**Labels used**: "Thinking," "feeling," "sensing" only

**Focus**: Get comfortable with the method

**Expectation**: Lots of noting is normal

### Intermediate Phase (Weeks 5-12)

Developing skill:

**Session length**: 15-20 minutes daily

**Labels expanded**: Add specific labels as useful

**Pattern awareness**: Notice your common thoughts

**Application**: Begin noting in daily life

### Advanced Phase (Ongoing)

Full integration:

**Session length**: 20+ minutes as desired

**Noting as natural**: Happens automatically

**Competition application**: Use during performance

**Life integration**: Awareness throughout the day

## Noting vs. Other Techniques

### Noting vs. Mantra

Two concentration approaches:

**[Mantra](/blog/mantra-meditation-athletes)**: Gives the mind something to do

**Noting**: Labels what the mind is already doing

**Different purposes**: Mantra builds focus; noting builds awareness

**Can combine**: Use both in different sessions

### Noting vs. Open Awareness

Degrees of structure:

**[Open awareness](/blog/open-awareness-meditation)**: Notice everything without labeling

**Noting**: Label what you notice

**Noting as scaffold**: Can lead to open awareness

**Different development**: Some prefer one, some the other

### Noting vs. Breath Focus

Anchor approaches:

**Breath focus**: Stay with breath, note when distracted

**Pure noting**: Everything is noted, no primary anchor

**Common combination**: Breath anchor with noting for distractions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Noting labels mental activity**—simple words like "thinking" or "worrying"
2. **The label creates distance**—you observe thoughts rather than become them
3. **Each note is a return**—the practice is coming back to the present
4. **Pattern recognition develops**—you learn your mental tendencies
5. **Keep it simple**—brief, neutral labels; don't overthink
6. **Apply to competition**—note distracting thoughts, return to task
7. **Skill builds over time**—awareness becomes automatic
