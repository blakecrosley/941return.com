Many Christians feel drawn to meditation but wonder if it conflicts with their faith. They may not know that Christianity has its own rich contemplative tradition stretching back to the earliest centuries of the church. The Desert Fathers and Mothers, medieval mystics like Meister Eckhart and The Cloud of Unknowing author, Teresa of Ávila and John of the Cross—all explored the depths of interior prayer.

Modern movements like Centering Prayer and Christian Meditation have made these practices accessible again. For believers seeking contemplative depth within their tradition, these paths offer what they're looking for.

## The Contemplative Tradition

### Historical Roots

**The Desert Fathers and Mothers:**
In the 3rd and 4th centuries, Christians retreated to the Egyptian desert seeking God through silence, simplicity, and inner stillness. Their teachings on prayer, thoughts, and the spiritual life remain influential.

**Hesychasm:**
The Eastern Orthodox tradition of inner stillness (hesychia), developed particularly on Mount Athos. The practice of the Jesus Prayer and pursuit of direct experience of divine light.

**Medieval mystics:**
Meister Eckhart, Julian of Norwich, The Cloud of Unknowing author, Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross—voices from medieval Europe describing stages of contemplative prayer and union with God.

**Modern renewal:**
Thomas Merton's writings, the Centering Prayer movement (Thomas Keating, Basil Pennington), and John Main's Christian Meditation revived contemplative practice for contemporary seekers.

### What Contemplation Is

**Beyond words:**
Active prayer uses words and thoughts. Contemplation moves beyond them—resting in God's presence without mental activity.

**Infused prayer:**
Traditionally, contemplation is considered a gift—something God does in the soul rather than something we achieve through technique.

**Receptivity:**
The essence is receptivity: consenting to God's presence and action, opening to divine love, letting go of our own agenda.

### Contemplation vs. Meditation

**Historical distinction:**
In traditional Christian usage, meditation meant discursive thought about scripture or divine things (what Lectio Divina calls "meditatio"). Contemplation meant wordless resting in God.

**Modern confusion:**
Today, "meditation" often means non-discursive practice. Christian meditation movements use the term for practices similar to traditional contemplation.

**The key:**
Terminology varies. What matters is the practice: moving from thinking about God to simply being present with God.

## Centering Prayer

### The Practice

**Overview:**
Developed by Trappist monks Thomas Keating, William Meninger, and Basil Pennington in the 1970s, drawing on The Cloud of Unknowing and other contemplative sources.

**The method:**
1. Choose a sacred word (God, Jesus, Love, Peace, etc.) as symbol of your consent to God's presence
2. Sit comfortably, eyes closed
3. Introduce the sacred word as intention to consent
4. When thoughts arise, return gently to the sacred word
5. End with brief silence and a prayer (like the Lord's Prayer)

**Duration:**
Twenty minutes twice daily is recommended. Many start with once daily.

### Key Points

**The sacred word:**
Not a mantra—not repeated continuously. It's a symbol of intention, used only when you notice engagement with thoughts.

**Thoughts are normal:**
The practice isn't about achieving thoughtlessness but consenting to God's presence regardless of mental activity. Thoughts come; you return to intention.

**Not about feeling:**
You may feel peace, or you may feel restless. Results aren't experienced during prayer but in the fruits in daily life.

**Divine therapy:**
Keating describes the practice as "divine therapy"—a process where God gradually heals deep emotional wounds stored in the unconscious.

### The Guidelines

**Four Guidelines of Centering Prayer:**

1. Choose a sacred word as the symbol of your intention to consent to God's presence and action within
2. Sitting comfortably and with eyes closed, settle briefly and silently introduce the sacred word
3. When engaged with thoughts, return ever so gently to the sacred word
4. At the end of the prayer period, remain in silence with eyes closed for a couple of minutes

## The Jesus Prayer

### The Practice

**The prayer:**
"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." Sometimes shortened to "Lord Jesus, have mercy" or simply "Jesus."

**The method:**
Repeat the prayer continuously—with the lips, then mentally, until it becomes continuous in the heart.

**The tradition:**
Central to Eastern Orthodox spirituality, documented in texts like The Way of a Pilgrim and The Philokalia.

### How to Practice

**Beginning:**
Start with set periods of practice. Sit quietly, breathe naturally, and repeat the prayer.

**With breath:**
Many coordinate the prayer with breathing: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God" on inhale, "have mercy on me, a sinner" on exhale.

**Throughout the day:**
The prayer is meant to become continuous—prayed during all activities until it continues even in sleep.

**The prayer rope:**
Orthodox tradition uses a prayer rope (chotki/komboskini) similar to a mala, to count repetitions.

### The Goal

**Prayer of the heart:**
The prayer descends from the mind to the heart. It becomes spontaneous, continuous, arising without effort.

**Theosis:**
The ultimate aim is theosis—divinization, participation in divine nature. The prayer is a vehicle for transformation.

## Lectio Divina

### The Practice

**Divine reading:**
Slow, contemplative reading of scripture. Not study but prayerful encounter with the living word.

**The four movements:**
1. **Lectio (reading):** Read a short passage slowly, attentively
2. **Meditatio (meditation):** Reflect on what strikes you, turn it over in your mind
3. **Oratio (prayer):** Respond to God based on what arose—praise, petition, thanksgiving
4. **Contemplatio (contemplation):** Rest in God's presence beyond words

### How to Practice

**Choose a passage:**
Short is better—a few verses. Gospels work particularly well.

**Read slowly:**
Not for information but encounter. Read aloud if it helps. Read multiple times.

**Notice what resonates:**
A word, phrase, or image that catches your attention. Stay with it.

**Respond:**
Talk to God about what arose. Let it become prayer.

**Rest:**
Eventually, words fade. Simply be present. This is the contemplative heart of the practice.

### In Community

**Shared Lectio:**
Can be practiced in groups. Read the passage, share what struck each person (without discussion), pray, rest together in silence.

## Other Practices

### The Examen

**Ignatian practice:**
A daily review developed by St. Ignatius of Loyola. Typically done at day's end.

**The steps:**
1. Become aware of God's presence
2. Review the day with gratitude
3. Pay attention to emotions—where was there consolation or desolation?
4. Choose one feature of the day to pray about
5. Look toward tomorrow

**Contemplative element:**
The Examen develops awareness of God's movement through ordinary life—a form of contemplation in action.

### Christian Meditation (John Main)

**The method:**
Choose a sacred word or phrase (maranatha is commonly used). Repeat it continuously throughout the meditation period.

**The teacher:**
John Main, a Benedictine monk, developed this approach drawing on the Desert Fathers and his earlier encounter with a Hindu teacher.

**The organization:**
The World Community for Christian Meditation continues this tradition with groups worldwide.

**Difference from Centering Prayer:**
In Christian Meditation, the word is repeated continuously. In Centering Prayer, it's used only when returning from engagement with thoughts.

### Taizé Prayer

**The community:**
Taizé is an ecumenical monastic community in France. Their prayer form combines simple chants, scripture, and silence.

**The practice:**
Repetitive, meditative chants sung in candlelit settings. Extended silence. The combination induces contemplative states.

**Accessibility:**
Taizé prayer is practiced in churches worldwide. The musical form makes contemplative practice accessible to those who struggle with silent methods.

### The Practice of the Presence of God

**Brother Lawrence:**
A 17th-century Carmelite monk who practiced continuous awareness of God while working in the monastery kitchen.

**The method:**
Simply turning attention to God's presence throughout all activities. No formal technique—just continuous remembrance.

**The teaching:**
God is present in every moment. We need only turn our attention to recognize this. The practice is the turning.

## Common Questions

### "Is This Really Christian?"

**The concern:**
Some Christians worry that contemplative practices are borrowed from Eastern religions or involve emptying the mind dangerously.

**The response:**
Christian contemplation has deep roots in scripture and tradition. The Desert Fathers preceded any Eastern influence on Christianity. The practices empty the mind of distractions to fill it with God's presence.

**Scripture:**
"Be still and know that I am God" (Psalm 46:10). "When you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret" (Matthew 6:6).

### "What About the Dangers of Emptying the Mind?"

**The distinction:**
Christian contemplation isn't about achieving a blank mind but about consenting to God's presence. The intention is Godward.

**The context:**
Practice happens within faith context: relationship with Christ, community, scripture, sacraments. It's not isolated technique.

**Discernment:**
Working with a spiritual director helps navigate any confusion or difficulty that arises.

### "Should I Stop My Other Prayers?"

**No:**
Contemplative practice supplements, doesn't replace. Liturgy, petition, praise, intercession—all remain part of Christian life.

**Integration:**
Many find contemplative practice deepens appreciation for other forms of prayer rather than competing with them.

### "What If Nothing Happens?"

**The teaching:**
Contemplative prayer isn't about experiences. You're offering yourself to God; the fruits appear in daily life—more patience, more compassion, more peace—not necessarily during prayer itself.

**Fidelity:**
The practice is showing up faithfully. God works in ways we can't perceive. Trust the process.

## Getting Started

### Begin Simply

**Today:**
Sit for 20 minutes. Use a sacred word or simply rest in intention toward God's presence. When thoughts arise, return gently to your intention.

That's all. The practice is simple. The depth unfolds over years of faithful practice.
