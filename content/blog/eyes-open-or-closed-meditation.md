New meditators often assume eyes should be closed. Then they encounter Zen, where eyes stay open. Or Tibetan practices, where it varies by technique. The confusion is understandable: traditions differ, and each has its reasons.

The short answer is that both work. The longer answer is that each has advantages and disadvantages. Understanding them helps you choose—or experiment—intelligently.

## What Each Tradition Does

### Eyes Closed

**Vipassana/Insight meditation:**
Most insight meditation traditions in the Theravada lineage practice with eyes closed.

**Hindu practices:**
Yoga meditation, mantra repetition, and most Hindu practices use closed eyes.

**MBSR:**
Secular mindfulness typically uses closed eyes.

**Christian contemplation:**
Most Christian meditation keeps eyes closed.

### Eyes Open

**Zen:**
Eyes remain partially open, gazing downward at 45 degrees, unfocused.

**Tibetan Buddhism:**
Varies by practice. Many Dzogchen and Mahamudra practices use open eyes; visualization practices often use closed eyes.

**Taoist meditation:**
Often eyes remain slightly open or look at specific points.

### Partially Open

**Soft gaze:**
Eyes slightly open, not focusing on anything, gaze lowered. Common in Zen.

**The compromise:**
Some teachers recommend this as middle ground—reducing visual distraction while maintaining some environmental connection.

## Arguments for Closed Eyes

### Less Distraction

**The case:**
Vision is our dominant sense. Closing eyes removes a major source of distraction. Nothing to look at; attention turns inward more easily.

**For beginners:**
This is why most beginners start with closed eyes. Fewer inputs to manage.

### Easier Interiorization

**The effect:**
Closed eyes signal to the nervous system that we're turning inward. It's a natural signal for rest and internal focus.

**For concentration:**
When developing one-pointed attention, closing eyes removes a competing channel of information.

### Privacy and Vulnerability

**The psychology:**
Closed eyes feel safer. You're not exposed to the gaze of others. This can support deeper relaxation and letting go.

**For emotional practice:**
If practice involves vulnerable emotions or tears, closed eyes provide privacy.

## Arguments for Open Eyes

### Staying Awake

**The challenge:**
Closed eyes invite sleepiness. The association with sleep is strong.

**The solution:**
Open eyes keep the system more alert. Light entering the eyes affects circadian rhythm and arousal.

**For drowsy sitters:**
If sleepiness is your main challenge, open eyes may help.

### Integration with Life

**The principle:**
Life happens with eyes open. Practicing with eyes open trains awareness that carries into daily life more directly.

**The bridge:**
Open-eyed meditation blurs the line between formal practice and ordinary activity.

### Avoiding Spacing Out

**The pattern:**
Some people close their eyes and disappear into thought or fantasy, mistaking this for meditation.

**The correction:**
Open eyes provide an anchor to present reality. Harder to completely space out when you're still seeing.

### Non-Escape

**The philosophy:**
Zen particularly emphasizes that meditation isn't escape from reality but engagement with it. Eyes open reflects this.

**Not rejecting appearances:**
Open eyes include visual phenomena in practice rather than shutting them out.

## What Actually Happens

### With Closed Eyes

**Advantages:**
- Easier concentration
- Fewer distractions
- More natural for beginners
- Supports interiorization
- Feels more "meditative"

**Challenges:**
- Invites sleepiness
- Can encourage spacing out
- Less connection to environment
- Harder to transfer to daily life

### With Open Eyes

**Advantages:**
- Maintains alertness
- Connects to environment
- Harder to space out
- More transferable to activity
- Trains presence in the world

**Challenges:**
- More distracting initially
- Takes practice to stabilize
- Can feel less "meditative"
- Visual phenomena can capture attention

### The Gaze Matters

**If eyes are open:**
The quality of gaze makes a difference.

**Soft, unfocused:**
Looking without looking at anything specific. Wide, peripheral, relaxed. Not tracking movement or reading details.

**Downcast:**
Looking at floor several feet ahead, not at the horizon or surroundings. Zen specifically recommends this.

**Fixed point:**
Some traditions use trataka—gazing at a single point (candle, dot, nose tip). Different from general open-eyed sitting.

## Choosing Your Approach

### Consider Your Challenges

**If sleepiness dominates:**
Open eyes may help. The visual input keeps arousal higher.

**If distraction dominates:**
Closed eyes may help. Remove visual input to simplify the field.

**If you space out:**
Open eyes may help. Harder to disappear into fantasy when you're still seeing.

**If you're anxious:**
Closed eyes may help. Less input, more sense of safety.

### Consider Your Practice

**Concentration practices:**
Closed eyes often work better. You're developing one-pointed attention—why add visual input?

**Open awareness:**
Open eyes make sense. You're training to be aware of all experience—vision included.

**Visualization:**
Usually closed eyes. You're generating internal images—external vision interferes.

**Movement meditation:**
Obviously open eyes. Walking or moving requires seeing.

### Consider Your Tradition

**If you practice within a tradition:**
Follow its guidance, at least initially. Traditions have reasons for their choices.

**If exploring:**
Experiment. See what works for your body and mind.

**If secular:**
You have freedom to choose. Use what serves you.

### Experiment

**Try both:**
Spend a week with closed eyes, a week with open. Notice the differences.

**Same session:**
Start with eyes open to establish alertness, close them after settling.

**Notice patterns:**
What happens to sleepiness, distraction, depth, integration? Let experience guide you.

## Common Issues

### With Closed Eyes

**Sleepiness:**
If you consistently fall asleep, try opening eyes—at least partially or periodically.

**Spacing out:**
If sessions become dreamy wandering, open eyes may provide more grounding.

**Eyelid tension:**
Straining to keep eyes closed creates tension. Let them rest naturally.

### With Open Eyes

**Visual distraction:**
Movements, changes in light, objects of interest pull attention. Soften focus; don't look at anything in particular.

**Eye strain:**
Staring without blinking strains eyes. Blink naturally. Don't stare intensely.

**Feels wrong:**
If you've always closed eyes, open feels strange. Give it time. Unfamiliarity isn't wrongness.

**Others watching:**
If you meditate with others (or pets) around, open eyes may feel vulnerable. This is normal.

### With Partially Open

**Determining position:**
How open is "slightly open"? Experiment. Eyes about one-quarter to one-third open is common.

**Focus creep:**
Eyes may start focused on nothing, then unconsciously start looking at something. Notice and soften when this happens.

## Special Circumstances

### Visualization Practice

**Generally closed:**
When generating mental images, external vision competes. Closed eyes give internal imagery more space.

**After the visualization:**
Some traditions open eyes at certain points—dissolving the visualization while keeping eyes open.

### Candle Gazing (Trataka)

**Open for gazing:**
The practice requires looking at the flame.

**Closed for afterimage:**
After gazing, eyes close to watch the internal afterimage.

### Walking Meditation

**Obviously open:**
You need to see where you're going.

**Soft gaze:**
Eyes open but gaze soft, lowered, not looking around. Peripheral awareness rather than focused attention.

### Lying Down

**Often closed:**
Lying with eyes open is unusual and can be uncomfortable.

**Risk:**
Eyes closed while lying invites sleep. Be aware.

### Outdoor Meditation

**Eyes open works well:**
Nature provides a calming visual field. Soft gaze at scenery can be meditative.

**Eyes closed can work:**
But may feel odd or vulnerable in public outdoor settings.

## The Integration View

### Meditation and Life

**The question:**
What are you training for? If it's only to sit in a dark room with eyes closed, closed eyes are sufficient.

**But:**
Most people want to bring meditative awareness into daily life. Open-eyed practice bridges that gap.

**The integration:**
Some practitioners close eyes for formal sitting, practice open awareness with eyes open throughout the day. The formal practice feeds the informal.

### What the Masters Say

**Zen teacher:**
Eyes open because practice isn't separate from life.

**Vipassana teacher:**
Eyes closed to turn attention inward and reduce distraction.

**Tibetan teacher:**
Depends on the practice—some require open, some closed.

**None are wrong:**
Each approach has purpose within its context.

## The Bottom Line

There's no universally correct answer. Both eyes open and eyes closed work. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

**Start with what works:**
For most beginners, closed eyes are easier.

**Adapt as needed:**
If sleepiness is your challenge, open eyes. If distraction overwhelms you, close them.

**Follow your tradition:**
If you practice within a tradition, use their guidance.

**Experiment:**
If you're secular or eclectic, try both and see.

**Don't obsess:**
This is a detail. Excessive concern about eye position is itself a distraction. Choose something and practice.

The awakening of great sages throughout history wasn't determined by their eye position. It was determined by their practice. Focus there.
