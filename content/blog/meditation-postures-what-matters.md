Posture anxiety is common among new meditators. Can I use a chair? What if I can't sit cross-legged? What's the right position for my hands? These concerns, while understandable, often distract from what matters: actually practicing.

The truth is simpler than the images suggest. You need a position that's sustainable and supports alertness. Everything else is detail.

## The Principles

### What Posture Actually Does

**Supports alertness:**
The position should keep you awake. Too comfortable and you'll drift. The body's configuration affects the mind's state.

**Allows stillness:**
You'll be here for 10, 20, 30 minutes or more. The position needs to be sustainable without constant adjustment.

**Minimizes distraction:**
Significant pain distracts. The goal is a position where the body can be relatively quiet so attention can settle.

### What Matters Most

**Upright spine:**
Whether on floor or chair, an upright spine supports alertness. Slouching compresses organs and invites sleepiness.

**Stability:**
A base that doesn't require constant adjustment. Three points of contact with the ground (both knees and seat, or both feet and seat).

**Sustainability:**
You need to maintain this position for your practice duration. Be realistic about your body.

### What Matters Less

**Floor versus chair:**
Many traditions emphasize floor sitting. Others don't care. Serious practitioners use both successfully.

**Specific leg position:**
Full lotus, half lotus, Burmese, kneeling—all work. Choose based on your body, not ideals.

**Hand position:**
Mudras have traditional meanings, but the mind doesn't know what your hands are doing. Pick something and stay consistent.

## Floor Positions

### Full Lotus

**The position:**
Each foot on the opposite thigh. Both knees on the floor.

**The stability:**
When you can do it, it's the most stable position. Triangular base, nowhere to fall.

**The reality:**
Most Western bodies can't do this comfortably, especially early in practice. Forcing it causes injuries.

**The verdict:**
If your body allows it easily, great. If not, use another position.

### Half Lotus

**The position:**
One foot on the opposite thigh, the other foot under the opposite thigh.

**The accessibility:**
More achievable than full lotus for many people.

**The asymmetry:**
Alternate which leg is on top between sessions to avoid imbalance.

**The verdict:**
A good option if it's comfortable. Don't force it.

### Quarter Lotus

**The position:**
One foot rests on the opposite calf (not thigh), the other under.

**The ease:**
More accessible than half lotus while still being cross-legged.

**The verdict:**
A reasonable compromise between classical position and accessibility.

### Burmese Position

**The position:**
Both feet on the floor in front of you (not crossed), knees out to sides, ankles not stacked.

**The accessibility:**
Much easier on the hips and knees than lotus variations.

**The stability:**
Both knees can reach the floor in this position, creating stability.

**The verdict:**
The most accessible floor position for most people. Nothing wrong with using it permanently.

### Seiza (Kneeling)

**The position:**
Kneeling with buttocks on heels, or on a bench or cushion between the heels.

**The benefit:**
Naturally upright spine. Takes pressure off hips that may be tight.

**The support:**
Use a seiza bench or stacked cushions under the buttocks to reduce ankle and knee pressure.

**The verdict:**
Excellent for those with hip tightness. Some people use this exclusively.

### Sitting on a Cushion

**Why it helps:**
Elevating the hips allows the knees to drop below the pelvis, reducing strain on hips and lower back.

**How much height:**
Experiment. Too low and knees hover; too high and you tip forward. Most people need 3-6 inches of lift.

**Cushion types:**
Zafu (round), gomden (square, firmer), seiza bench, or improvised (folded blankets, pillows).

## Chair Sitting

### The Position

**The setup:**
Sit toward the front of the chair. Feet flat on the floor. Spine upright, not leaning against the back (unless needed).

**The height:**
Thighs approximately horizontal. If the chair is too high, use a footrest. If too low, add a cushion.

**The hands:**
On thighs or in lap.

### When to Use a Chair

**Physical limitations:**
Injury, disability, chronic pain, or simple inflexibility may make floor sitting impractical.

**Preference:**
Some people prefer chairs. That's fine. The practice isn't in the position.

**Variation:**
Even floor-sitters sometimes use chairs when the body needs a break.

### Making It Work

**Alertness:**
Not leaning back helps maintain alertness. If you need back support, use it—sleepiness from pain is worse than sleepiness from comfort.

**Stability:**
Feet firmly planted creates grounding similar to floor sitting.

**No stigma:**
There's nothing inferior about chair meditation. Many traditions include it; others don't care.

## The Spine

### The Instruction

**Upright:**
Spine elongated but not rigid. Natural curves maintained. Not ramrod straight but not collapsed.

**Relaxed:**
Alert but not tense. The spine supports itself; excessive muscular gripping isn't needed.

**Balanced:**
Head balanced on top of spine, not jutting forward or tilted.

### Common Issues

**Collapsed posture:**
Slouching compresses organs, invites sleepiness, and can cause back pain.

**Fix:** Imagine a string pulling the crown of your head upward.

**Overstraight:**
Rigid military posture creates tension and is unsustainable.

**Fix:** Allow natural curves. Relax shoulders down and back.

**Forward head:**
Head drifts forward of the spine.

**Fix:** Tuck chin slightly. Feel head balanced on spine.

### Adjusting During Sitting

**What's normal:**
Posture degrades during sitting. This is universal.

**The response:**
Periodically adjust when you notice slouching. Don't make it a big deal—just reestablish.

**The learning:**
Over time, good posture becomes more natural and requires less adjustment.

## Hands and Arms

### The Options

**In lap:**
One hand cradling the other, thumbs touching or nearly touching. Creates a closed circuit.

**On thighs:**
Hands resting on thighs or knees, palms down or up.

**Mudras:**
Specific hand positions with traditional meanings. Choose based on tradition or preference.

### What Works

**Any stable position:**
Hands shouldn't need adjustment. Find something and keep it.

**Shoulders relaxed:**
Arms shouldn't create tension. Elbows roughly at sides, not pushed forward or back.

**The truth:**
This matters less than you think. Pick something and stop worrying about it.

## Head, Eyes, Mouth

### Head Position

**Balanced:**
Head rests easily on spine. Not tilted forward, back, or to either side.

**Chin:**
Slightly tucked rather than lifted. This helps maintain neck's natural curve.

### Eyes

**Closed:**
Most common in many traditions. Reduces visual distraction.

**Partially open:**
Zen style—eyes slightly open, gazing downward at 45 degrees, unfocused. Maintains connection with environment.

**Both work:**
Closed is easier for most people. Open works for those prone to sleepiness or spacing out.

### Mouth

**Gently closed:**
Tongue can rest on the roof of the mouth (traditional instruction) or wherever is natural.

**Jaw relaxed:**
Not clenched. A slight space between teeth.

## Common Problems

### Pain During Sitting

**The question:**
Is this the productive discomfort of sitting still, or is something wrong?

**Normal:**
Mild to moderate discomfort that shifts and changes. The body adjusting to stillness.

**Problem signs:**
Sharp pain, numbness, pain that persists after sitting, pain that worsens over sessions.

**Response:**
Adjust the position. Try a different sitting style. Use more support. Pain that causes injury isn't serving practice.

### Sleepiness

**If you're falling asleep:**
- Sit more upright
- Open eyes
- Use a higher seat
- Practice at a more alert time
- Ensure adequate sleep

**The position's role:**
Too comfortable invites sleep. But too painful distracts. Find the middle.

### Restlessness

**If you can't sit still:**
- Start with shorter sessions
- Use walking meditation between sitting periods
- Let the body move briefly, then resettle
- Investigate: what's driving the restlessness?

## Finding Your Position

### The Process

**Experiment:**
Try different positions. Notice what works for your body.

**Give time:**
A position may be uncomfortable at first but improve with practice. Give each option a fair trial.

**Adjust:**
Modify with cushions, benches, or supports until it works.

**Accept:**
Your position may not match photos. That's fine. The practice is internal.

### Questions to Ask

**Can I maintain this for my practice duration?**
Not perfectly comfortable, but sustainable.

**Am I alert or drowsy?**
The position should support wakefulness.

**Am I causing injury?**
Pain that persists or worsens is a problem.

**Am I overthinking this?**
Probably. Sit down and practice.

## The Bottom Line

The best posture is the one that allows you to practice. Full lotus isn't better than chair sitting if it causes you pain or discourages practice. A chair isn't inferior if it keeps you practicing.

Find something sustainable. Maintain an upright spine. Show up consistently.

The awakened sages of history used various positions. Some sat on rocks, some on cushions, some on nothing. What they shared was practice, not posture.

Sit down. Start practicing. Adjust as needed. The rest sorts itself out.
