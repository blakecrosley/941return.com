Almost everyone who meditates wonders if they're doing it right. You sit down, try to follow instructions, and find yourself wondering: Is this what it's supposed to feel like? Am I wasting my time? Should something be happening that isn't?

These doubts are nearly universal—and usually unfounded. Here's what "correct" meditation actually means.

## The Good News First

### You're Probably Doing It Right

**The reality:**
If you're sitting down with intention to practice, following basic instructions, and showing up consistently—you're meditating correctly. The bar is lower than you think.

**The problem isn't technique:**
Most people's concerns aren't about doing something technically wrong. They're about expectations not matching experience.

**The reassurance:**
The fact that you're questioning your practice is actually a sign of awareness. Totally checked-out people don't wonder if they're checked out.

## What Correct Meditation Is Not

### Not a Blank Mind

**The misconception:**
"I'm thinking, so I must be doing it wrong."

**The reality:**
Thoughts arising is completely normal—expected, even. You're not supposed to achieve thoughtlessness. You're supposed to notice thoughts and return to your object of focus.

**The check:**
Are you noticing when you're thinking? That noticing is the practice. If you weren't aware of thoughts, you wouldn't know you were having them.

### Not Constant Focus

**The misconception:**
"I keep losing focus, so I'm failing."

**The reality:**
Losing focus is part of the process. You focus, you wander, you notice, you return. That cycle IS the practice—not a failure of it.

**The check:**
Are you returning when you notice you've wandered? That's correct practice. The wandering isn't the problem; not returning would be.

### Not Feeling Blissful

**The misconception:**
"I don't feel peaceful or blissful, so it's not working."

**The reality:**
Pleasant states come and go. Many sessions feel ordinary, even difficult. The goal isn't to manufacture pleasant feelings.

**The check:**
Are you staying with your experience as it is—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? That's correct practice, regardless of how it feels.

### Not Dramatic Experiences

**The misconception:**
"Nothing special is happening. Other people have visions and insights."

**The reality:**
Dramatic experiences are rare and unreliable markers of progress. Steady, undramatic practice is more valuable than occasional fireworks.

**The check:**
Are you showing up consistently, doing the practice, and not chasing experiences? That's correct practice.

## What Correct Meditation Actually Is

### Following Instructions

**The essence:**
You've received instructions—from a teacher, a book, an app. Are you following them?

**For breath meditation:**
Attention on breath. When attention wanders, return to breath. That's it.

**For noting:**
Note what arises. Return to primary object. That's it.

**For open awareness:**
Rest in awareness without fixating. When you fixate, release and return to openness.

**The check:**
Can you describe what you're supposed to be doing? Are you doing it (or trying to)? That's correct.

### Returning When You Notice

**The core skill:**
The fundamental movement of meditation is noticing you've wandered and coming back.

**Not:**
- Never wandering (impossible)
- Forcing attention to stay (unsustainable)
- Feeling bad about wandering (unhelpful)

**But:**
Noticing when attention has left, and gently returning. Over and over.

**The check:**
When you realize you've been lost in thought, what happens? If you return to your practice, you're doing it correctly.

### Showing Up Consistently

**What matters more:**
Regular practice matters more than perfect sessions.

**The math:**
Imperfect daily practice beats occasional perfect practice.

**The check:**
Are you sitting regularly? That's probably the most important measure of correct practice.

### Not Trying Too Hard

**The paradox:**
Effort is needed, but forcing doesn't help.

**The quality:**
Gentle persistence. Relaxed attention. Not slack, not strained.

**The check:**
Are you relaxed while also engaged? Or are you gripping, controlling, struggling? Ease off if you're pushing too hard.

## Common Concerns Addressed

### "I Can't Stop Thinking"

**Why it's not a problem:**
The instruction isn't to stop thinking. It's to notice thinking and return to focus.

**What happens over time:**
With practice, you notice sooner. Gaps between thoughts may lengthen. But thoughts continue—that's how minds work.

**The reframe:**
Every time you notice thinking, that's a moment of awareness. That moment is practice.

### "I Keep Falling Asleep"

**Why it's common:**
Relaxation plus closed eyes invites sleep, especially if you're tired.

**The response:**
Try meditating earlier in the day. Sit upright. Open eyes. Increase alertness without tension.

**When it's not a problem:**
Occasionally drowsy sessions are normal. Consistent sleepiness needs adjustment.

### "My Mind Is Busier Than Before"

**Why it seems that way:**
You're probably not thinking more—you're noticing more. Awareness of thoughts isn't the same as more thoughts.

**The good sign:**
Increased awareness of mental activity is progress. You're seeing what was always there.

**The patience:**
This often settles with continued practice. The mind learns you're watching.

### "Nothing Is Happening"

**The question:**
What did you expect to happen?

**The reframe:**
If you're sitting, following instructions, and practicing—that IS something happening. Transformation happens gradually, not dramatically.

**The trust:**
Effects often appear in daily life, not during sitting: more patience, less reactivity, more equanimity. Notice there.

### "I'm Not Getting Better"

**Progress is subtle:**
You may not notice your own progress. It's like watching children grow—hard to see day by day.

**Ask others:**
People around you might notice changes before you do. Are you more patient? Less reactive? More present?

**Redefine better:**
What does "better" mean? More concentrated? More peaceful? Fewer thoughts? These may not be the right metrics.

### "Everyone Else Gets It But Me"

**The comparison trap:**
You're comparing your inside to others' outside. You don't know their experience.

**The reality:**
Almost everyone struggles. Almost everyone doubts. The serene meditator you imagine is probably as confused as you.

**The instruction:**
Stay with your own practice. Comparison isn't part of the method.

## Signs You're On Track

### During Practice

**You notice when you've wandered:**
This means awareness is developing.

**You can return without drama:**
No judgment, no frustration—just returning.

**Some sessions feel easier:**
Not all, but sometimes. This indicates growing skill.

**You're more familiar with your mind:**
You know its patterns, its tendencies. This is self-knowledge.

### In Daily Life

**More equanimity:**
Life's ups and downs affect you less.

**Increased patience:**
Things that bothered you bother you less.

**More presence:**
You catch yourself more often—aware rather than automatic.

**Reduced reactivity:**
Space between stimulus and response. Choice where there was reflex.

### Over Time

**Continued practice:**
You're still doing it. That's success.

**Deepening interest:**
You want to learn more, practice more, understand more.

**Integration:**
Practice affects life; life affects practice. They're less separate.

## When Something Might Actually Be Wrong

### You're Not Following Instructions

**The issue:**
You're doing your own thing, not the prescribed method.

**The solution:**
Review the instructions. Are you actually doing what was taught?

### You're Hurting Yourself

**The issue:**
Physical pain from posture, or psychological distress from practice.

**The solution:**
Adjust posture if it's physical. Consult a teacher if it's psychological. Some experiences need guidance.

### You're Using It to Avoid

**The issue:**
Meditation as escape—from emotions, problems, life.

**The solution:**
Genuine practice includes difficult experiences, not avoids them.

### You're Becoming More Dysfunctional

**The issue:**
Life is getting worse, not better. More anxiety, more dissociation, more problems.

**The solution:**
Talk to a teacher. Some people need modified approaches or additional support.

## The Bottom Line

### The Real Test

**Is practice:**
Can you describe your practice method? Are you attempting to do it? Are you sitting consistently?

**Are you returning:**
When you wander, do you come back? That's the essential movement.

**Over time:**
Are you still practicing? Are you developing curiosity and patience with the process?

If yes to these—you're meditating correctly. The doubts are normal. The imperfection is normal. The continued practice despite imperfection IS the practice.

### What to Do with Doubt

**Notice it:**
"Doubting" is happening. You can observe doubt like any other mental event.

**Don't let it stop you:**
Practice anyway. Doubt doesn't mean the practice is wrong.

**Get guidance:**
If doubt persists, talk to a teacher. They've heard your concerns many times.

**Trust time:**
Keep practicing. Doubts often dissolve with experience.

You're probably doing it right. Keep sitting.
