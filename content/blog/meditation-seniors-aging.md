The body changes. Friends and partners die. The future shortens while the past lengthens. Aging is not for the faint of heart. But it's also an opportunity—for reflection, for wisdom, for being present with what remains rather than focusing on what's lost.

Meditation is particularly suited to aging. It requires no physical prowess, offers cognitive benefits, and directly addresses the existential questions that aging brings forward. Whether you're starting practice in your 60s or continuing decades of practice, aging and meditation have much to offer each other.
