A meditation timer should disappear into the practice. Return exists to start your session, keep time, and signal when you are done. Everything else stays out of the way.

## TL;DR

- Return works on iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, and Apple TV with synced settings
- Each platform suits different moments—phone for morning practice, watch for movement, TV for immersion
- Five themes match different moods and intentions
- Simplicity is the design goal—fewer features means less friction

## The Design Philosophy

Most meditation apps compete on features. Guided sessions, courses, social tracking, gamification, subscription tiers.

Return takes a different approach. The app provides a timer, ambient sound, and visual themes. Nothing else competes for attention during your practice.

This simplicity is intentional. Every additional feature creates a decision. Decisions create friction. Friction reduces consistency. Consistency determines whether meditation becomes a habit or an occasional activity.

## iPhone: The Primary Experience

For most users, iPhone serves as the primary meditation platform. The larger screen displays ambient visuals, and headphones or speakers provide immersive audio.

### Setting Your Timer

Open Return and tap anywhere on the screen to access timer settings. Choose your duration in minutes—the app remembers your selection for next time.

Popular duration choices:

- **5 minutes** — Minimum effective dose for nervous system regulation
- **10 minutes** — Standard session for daily practice
- **20 minutes** — Deeper practice when time allows
- **45 minutes** — Extended sessions for experienced practitioners

Interval bells provide optional checkpoints during longer sessions. Set them to chime every 5 or 10 minutes if you find it helpful to know how much time remains.

### Choosing a Theme

Five themes create different visual and audio environments:

**Water** — Teal tones with flowing ambient sound. Calming and fluid. Good for general practice and stress reduction.

**Fire** — Warm orange with crackling audio. Energizing and transformative. Suits morning practice or intention-setting sessions.

**Forest** — Green palette with nature sounds. Grounding and stable. Works well for anxiety or feeling scattered.

**Silence** — Muted gray with minimal audio. Pure stillness. For practitioners who prefer no sensory input.

**Health** — Soft pink with gentle tones. Recovery-focused. Designed for post-workout or healing-related meditation.

No theme is better than another. Choose based on what you need in this moment.

## Apple Watch: Meditation On Your Wrist

Apple Watch lets you meditate without your phone. Haptic feedback replaces sound for discreet practice anywhere.

### When Watch Works Best

- Post-workout cooldown at the gym
- Walking meditation outdoors
- Brief sessions during work breaks
- Travel without carrying multiple devices

### Using the Watch App

Open Return on your Apple Watch. The crown adjusts duration. Tap to start.

During meditation, the watch face shows remaining time and your selected theme color. When the session ends, gentle haptic pulses signal completion.

For silent practice, the watch delivers all cues through vibration. No one around you knows you are meditating.

### Standalone Sessions

Return works independently on Apple Watch. You do not need your phone nearby. Sessions still sync to your activity when devices reconnect.

## Mac: Desktop Practice

The Mac app brings meditation to your workspace. Practice between meetings, during lunch, or at the start of your workday.

### Desktop Advantages

- Larger screen for ambient visuals
- Better speakers or headphone connections
- No phone distractions during sessions
- Integrates with your existing work environment

### Workflow Integration

Consider using Return at natural transition points in your workday:

- Before your first meeting
- After a difficult conversation
- When switching between projects
- Before leaving for the day

Five minutes of meditation between contexts reduces cognitive carryover—the mental residue from one task that interferes with the next.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Space bar starts and pauses the timer. The simplicity continues at the input level.

## Apple TV: Immersive Environment

Apple TV transforms your living room into a meditation space. Large-screen visuals and room-filling audio create an environment rather than just a timer.

### Creating a Practice Space

The TV's ambient visuals work best in a dimmed room. The gentle motion and color provide a soft focal point—something to rest your eyes on without demanding attention.

Position yourself comfortably within view of the screen. You might sit on a cushion facing the TV, or recline with it in your peripheral vision.

### Shared Practice

Apple TV makes meditation accessible to others in your household. No personal devices required, no app downloads, no account creation. Someone curious about meditation can simply join your session.

The shared screen removes the isolation that can make starting meditation feel awkward for beginners.

## Building Your Practice

The platform matters less than consistency. Pick the device that removes friction from your practice:

- If you meditate in bed after waking, use iPhone
- If you meditate after workouts, use Apple Watch
- If you meditate at your desk, use Mac
- If you meditate with family, use Apple TV

Over time, you might use different devices for different contexts. Return syncs settings across all of them.

## Starting Points

If you are new to meditation, start small:

**Week 1:** Five minutes daily, any time that works
**Week 2:** Five minutes at a consistent time each day
**Week 3:** Increase to ten minutes or add a second session
**Week 4:** Notice when you want to meditate without reminding yourself

The goal is not perfection. The goal is showing up consistently enough that practice becomes default behavior.

## What a Timer Cannot Do

Return starts your session and keeps time. The practice itself comes from you.

No app can concentrate for you, quiet your thoughts for you, or build consistency for you. The timer creates structure. You bring attention.

This is good news. It means the practice is yours. The skill belongs to you, not to any tool you happen to use.
