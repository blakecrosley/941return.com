# Return App Integration Points

Guidelines for when and how to mention the Return app in blog content.

## Core Principle

**Lead with value, not product.** Every post should be useful to someone who never downloads the app. App mentions should feel like helpful suggestions, not advertisements.

## Integration Frequency

### Per Article Guidelines

- **Maximum 2 app mentions** per 1,000 words
- **Never in the opening** - earn attention first
- **Natural placement only** - if it feels forced, cut it

### Where to Integrate

**Good placements:**
- When discussing specific techniques the app supports
- In "how to practice" sections where a timer would help
- At article end as a "if you want to try this" suggestion
- In feature-focused articles (obviously)

**Poor placements:**
- Opening paragraphs
- Mid-explanation interruptions
- Every section
- As a solution to problems you just raised

## Integration Styles

### The Soft Mention
Use when the app is tangentially relevant:

> A meditation timer helps maintain consistency. Set it for five minutes and let the bell handle the timekeeping so you can focus on the breath.

(No app name needed - readers will connect if interested)

### The Direct Mention
Use when discussing specific app features:

> Return's Health theme pairs pink visuals with a calming soundscape designed specifically for recovery sessions. The combination supports the physiological shift from stress to rest.

### The CTA Close
Use at article end, once per piece maximum:

> If you're ready to start a meditation practice, Return offers a minimal timer designed to get out of your way. Available on iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, and Apple TV.

## What NOT to Do

### Hard Sell Language
- "You NEED Return to meditate properly"
- "Return is the BEST meditation app"
- "Don't meditate without Return"

### Artificial Problems
- Creating problems just to solve them with the app
- Implying you can't meditate without an app
- Suggesting competitors are inadequate

### Over-featuring
- Listing every feature in non-feature articles
- Multiple CTAs in one article
- Promotional language ("limited time", "exclusive")

## Platform-Specific Mentions

When mentioning specific platforms, be relevant:

**Apple Watch context:**
> For walking meditation or post-workout sessions, a wrist-based timer keeps you present without reaching for your phone.

**Apple TV context:**
> Morning meditation on a large screen creates an immersive space. The ambient visuals provide a focal point without demanding attention.

**Mac context:**
> Desktop meditation fits between tasks. A quick five-minute session before a meeting resets your nervous system without leaving your workspace.

## The Authenticity Check

Before including an app mention, ask:
1. Would I include this if I didn't make the app?
2. Does it help the reader practice better?
3. Does it flow naturally in context?
4. Can I remove it without weakening the article?

If answers are No, Yes, Yes, No - include it.
If any answer breaks that pattern - reconsider.
