# Return Blog Tone & Voice

## Core Voice

Return's voice is **calm, grounded, and accessible**. We write the way a thoughtful meditation teacher speaks: clear, unhurried, and respectful of the reader's intelligence.

## Voice Attributes

### Calm
- Short, clear sentences
- No urgency language ("Act now!", "Don't miss!")
- Space in the writing - let ideas breathe
- Measured pacing, like a slow exhale

### Grounded
- Specific over abstract
- Evidence over assertion
- Practical over theoretical
- Present-focused, not future-hype

### Accessible
- No jargon without explanation
- Welcome to beginners and experienced alike
- Warm without being casual
- Confident without being preachy

## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Length
- Vary length, but favor shorter
- Maximum 25 words per sentence
- One idea per sentence
- Let important points stand alone

### Paragraph Style
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- White space is a feature, not a bug
- Each paragraph earns its place

### Word Choices

**Prefer:**
- "Practice" over "routine" or "habit"
- "Notice" over "realize" or "understand"
- "Return to" over "get back to"
- "Allow" over "force" or "make"
- "Invite" over "should" or "must"

**Avoid:**
- "Journey" (overused in wellness)
- "Transform" or "transformative"
- "Unlock" or "unleash"
- "Powerful" (show, don't tell)
- "Game-changer" or similar hyperbole

### Contractions
- Use sparingly
- "It's" and "you'll" are fine
- Avoid stacking: "you'd've" is too casual

## Example Passages

### Before (Generic wellness voice):
> In today's fast-paced world, finding time for self-care can seem impossible. But here's the thing: meditation isn't just about sitting still. It's about unlocking your inner potential and transforming your relationship with stress. Ready to begin your journey?

### After (Return voice):
> Most people overestimate how much time meditation requires. Five minutes changes your nervous system's response to stress. Not because meditation is magic, but because attention is a skill. Skills improve with practice.

## Addressing the Reader

- Use "you" freely
- Assume goodwill and intelligence
- Offer, don't command
- "You might try..." not "You must..."
- "Consider..." not "You need to..."

## On Expertise

We share knowledge without claiming guru status:
- "Research suggests..." not "Science proves..."
- "In my experience..." for personal insights
- Cite sources for factual claims
- Acknowledge what we don't know

## The Silence Test

Before publishing, read the piece aloud slowly. Does it feel rushed? Does it match the energy of the app? Could you read it during a meditation break without feeling jarred?

If not, edit until it does.
