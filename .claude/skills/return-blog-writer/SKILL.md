# Return Blog Writer

Specialized blog writing for Return, a minimal zen meditation timer app. Content focuses on meditation practice, athletic recovery, mindfulness, and wellness.

## Company Configuration

- **COMPANY-FACTS.yml** - Return app details, platforms, target audience
- **INTELLIGENCE-DOMAINS.yml** - Content domains we cover
- **TONE-VOICE.md** - Our calm, grounded voice
- **INTEGRATION-POINTS.md** - When and how to mention the app
- **SEO-STRATEGY.yml** - Target keywords and optimization

## Content Philosophy

Return's blog should feel like the app itself: minimal, purposeful, and grounded. Every post should leave readers feeling calmer and more informed, not overwhelmed.

### Writing Approach

1. **Start with value** - Lead with actionable insight, not product promotion
2. **Ground in science** - Support claims with research, but explain simply
3. **Respect the reader** - Assume intelligence, avoid condescension
4. **End with practice** - Give readers something concrete to try

### Content Types We Write

- **Guides** - How to use meditation for specific purposes (recovery, focus, sleep)
- **Science Explainers** - Research on meditation, recovery, and performance
- **Practice Pieces** - Specific techniques readers can implement immediately
- **App Features** - Thoughtful exploration of how Return supports practice

## Specific Rules for Return

1. **Never hard-sell** - The app mention should feel natural, not promotional
2. **Cite research** - Claims about meditation benefits need sources
3. **Stay practical** - Every post should include something actionable
4. **Match the aesthetic** - Writing should feel as minimal as the app design
